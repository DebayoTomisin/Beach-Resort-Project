Ideally i'll start with nothing to see here, but in this case there are quite a few things to see yeah 
I'll be building a website for a resort where folks can view the various plans and filter through the plans avaliable, i'll be using context API for state management (might switch to redux). and what makes it something to see is that i'll be deploying this on netlify once it is done as my first major react project.

I'll be editting this as the project progresses so yeah let's do this!
